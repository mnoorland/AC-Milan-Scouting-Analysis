# Statistical Analysis for AC Milan Scouting – Replacing Rafael Leão

## Project Overview
This project simulates the scouting department for AC Milan, aiming to find potential replacements for star player Rafael Leão. Using statistical analysis in both **R** and **Python**, we compared key performance metrics such as goals, assists, and market value across various players to identify suitable transfer targets. The analysis also considered age, match experience, and market value correlation to provide AC Milan with data-driven insights into potential replacements.

## Objectives
- **Identify a replacement** for Rafael Leão by analyzing key metrics (goals, assists, market value) of potential candidates.
- **Assess player performance** using advanced statistical techniques and visualizations.
- **Compare market values** of potential candidates to assess their cost-effectiveness for AC Milan.

## Key Features
- **Player Statistics Comparison**: Analyzed goals, assists, and other performance data for forwards across European football leagues.
- **Market Value Analysis**: Examined the correlation between player performance and market value to provide budget-friendly options.
- **Visualization**: Created graphs and charts comparing the stats of Rafael Leão and potential replacements.
  
## Tools & Technologies
